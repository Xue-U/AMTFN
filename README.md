# AMTFN: Adaptive Multi-Modal Transformer Fusion Network for Breast Cancer Survival Prediction

This repository contains the **public version** of the AMTFN framework, proposed for breast cancer survival prediction using multi-modal data (e.g., clinical and omics features).  
AMTFN integrates advanced **data balancing**, **hierarchical multi-modal feature fusion**, and **dynamic ensemble learning** to achieve robust and accurate survival prediction.


## Overview

**AMTFN** is designed to address key challenges in survival prediction:
- **Data imbalance** using *DCBGAN* for high-quality minority sample generation.
- **Hierarchical Dynamic Multi-modal Fusion (HDMF)** with Transformer encoders for adaptive cross-modal feature integration.
- **Dynamic Synergistic Integration (DSI)** for robust prediction by combining heterogeneous classifiers.

**Key Features**
- Adaptive fusion of clinical and omics features
-  Transformer-based attention mechanisms
-  State-of-the-art performance on METABRIC dataset
-  Resilient to class imbalance and label noise
